My app, when provided with a valid search term (valid terms are provided on the site), queries the BoredAPI
for an activity that falls under the search term. The app then queries the Spoify API for a related playlist,
then displays the playlist image as a link.

responsive: image size changed based on screen size, becomes relative at smaller scale.

uses 2 different APIs: search BoredAPI for an activity, search SpotifyAPI for the link and image of a playlist.

has search: able to search for a particular type of activity.

displays results: displays the activity chosen as well as matching playlist.

filterable: displays a random activity and matching playlist, as there are not multiple results there is no filtering present.
